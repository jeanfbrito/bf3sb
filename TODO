Frontend:
- User enters the username, selects the category (fav or recent) and gets the result
- Above result is fetched with Ajax
- Maybe a better server browser later on (maybe, maybe!)

Backend:
- Debug the script and catch exceptions
- Use database to store server info to speed up the script
- Implement a scraper which runs in background, scrapes bf3 server info and add them to DB
